# Two-phase-flow
Two-Phase Flow Visualization in Acrylic Pipe  • Designed and conducted an experiment to study air-water two-phase flow in an acrylic pipe.  • Classified flow regimes and visualized hydrodynamic interactions.
# Methodology / Experimental Setup
- Horizontal acrylic pipe setup- Water pumped at controlled flow rate- Air injected gradually using compressor- Flow regimes recorded for different flow rate
# Flow Regime Classification- Bubbly Flow
- Slug Flow- Churn Flow- Annular Flow
# Results & Observations
Visualized transitions between different flow regimes- Captured images/frames of bubbly, slug, churn, and annular flow- Constructed Flow Regime Map (Superficial Gas Velocity vs 
Superficial Liquid Velocity)
# Conclusion & Applications
Successfully visualized air-water flow patterns- Classified regimes experimentally- Applications in design of heat exchangers, nuclear reactors, 
oil & gas pipelines, and chemical industries
